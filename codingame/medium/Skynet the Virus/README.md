This is a simple graph problem.

There are graph data, position of 'Skynet agent' and Gateway node numbers.

Our goal is to prevent Skynet Agent get to the gateway.

This problem is so simple because we just can reprogram links that connected with gateway.

But there are additional achievement for consume less links.

So I calculated shortest path from gateway to Skynet agent every each turn. And reprogrammed nearest link from Skynet agent.
